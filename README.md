# Winnitron Launcher

##What it is
A front-end launcher for arcade machines.

##Installation
We'll put in how to install the launcher here soon.

##Branches

####Master
Where the meat of the project lies.  This is where final changes to the launcher will be committed.  In the past, we used it to commit everything but will be using this primarily for release versions of the launcher from now on.

####Develop
This is where we push changes to the latest version of the Winnitron Launcher.  When we have a stable release, we will merge it with the Master branch.

####V1
This is a branch where the first stable version of the Winnitron Launcher will live.  It has basic features such as loading games from folders, jukebox, and attract mode.  Bug fixes and other changes to this base version will continue to be updated here.
